  "problem": "Currently EMRs display too much information on the screen. This can overwhelm the user, the physician, by making all data have equal visual weight.",
  "solution": "Create a more welcoming display that allows important information to be more prominent and less relevant information to be tucked away neatly. The improvement in user experience for physicians will lessen stress and burnout.",
